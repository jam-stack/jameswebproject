    <h1>Unit 2: Website Software </h1>
    <h2>Outcome 1: Create structures and styles for a web </h2>
    <h3>2.1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
    <p>My website consists of four pages, 1st page is the home page that welcomes you to the website, the next page is the ‘about me’ this page has a brief description of me and what I have learnt from being at Codenation. 
        Then it moves to page which answers questions to unit 1 and finally a page that answers questions to unit 2. Each page is accessed be a navigation bar at the top of the page. 
        On the website it has a gif background of a cityscape pixel art this gives it a certain look which helps draw in the user. </p>
        <h3>2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
        <p>Copyright may affect your website because it may potentially limit what you are allowed to publish, infringing on a copyright may result in legal action against your website. 
            Other constraints might be flexibility of the website design will it work on different platforms and be easily navigated on mobile devices. This is something I had to be aware of, 
            knowing that if I used a certain image that could be using copyright I would have to remove it and replace it with another image that isn’t copyrighted, this could add time to the development of the website. </p>
            <h3>2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h3>
            <p>Designing a website needs to be able to be a ccessed by a wide range of people, this means that people with certain disabilities need to be taken into account. 
                This can be done in lots of different ways, for example people who are deaf need any audio to be accessed through text and subtitles, so that they don’t miss any content. 
                People who have limited vision or colour blindness need to be able to read the text, this may entail only using certain colours and fonts so that all information on the website is visible. 
                People who are physically disabled for example in their hand need to find navigation round the website easy and intuitive, this could be by using large buttons. </p>
                <h3>2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites </h3>
                <p>The files that are appropriate in website design are .AVi is an audio video file, .CSS used to help create websites and provides tools to improve how the site looks. 
                    Also there is .HTML also creates the pages and text of a website. Then there is .DOC is a word processing file, .GIF is a graphics interchange format which produces animated repeating clips. 
                    Then there are .JPG which is mainly used in photos. For streaming films you can use .MEPG which is a motion picture expert group files. A common file most people know is MP3 which is an audio file. 
                    PDF is a ‘portable document format’ which is a document file which can be shared and have uniform look across devices. A .TXT is a basic text file used in the likes of Notepad. </p>
