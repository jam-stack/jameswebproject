<body> <p>Hi my name is James.<br>After having worked in various jobs over the last few years, working as a camera operator, in community digital radio and supermarkets.
       I discovered Codenation through a recruitment session.<br>
       I have a drive and determination to learn new things and within the ever evolving IT environment I discovered a place where I can learn and adapt to the world of coding. 
       Entering Codenation on the first day I came with little to no knowledge of how computer  science worked, 
       I found it to be a steep learning curve, however with every passing day my understanding slowly built and created a rewarding experience.</p>
