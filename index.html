    <h1>About me</h1>
</div>
<body>
     Hi my name is James. After having worked in various jobs over the last few years, working as a camera operator, in community digital radio and supermarkets.
       I discovered Codenation through a recruitment session. 
       I have a drive and determination to learn new things and within the ever evolving IT environment I discovered a place where I can learn and adapt to the world of coding. 
       Entering Codenation on the first day I came with little to no knowledge of how computer  science worked, 
       I found it to be a steep learning curve but one with every passing day my understanding slowly built and created a rewarding experience.

    <h2>Unit 1: Improving Productivity with IT  Project: 1 </h2>
    <h3>1.1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>
    <p>IT connects people and businesses that only a few years ago that would have seemed Science fiction.
         As Abid Afzal a Freelance Writer and Researcher writes 
         “organisations that do invest in technology and choose the path of innovation increase their market share, 
         financial figures and overall competitiveness.” 

             <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-information-technology-business-success-abid-afzal-butt">[1].</a>
         IT allows businesses to innovate, which in turn can produce quicker cleverer apps, 
         speedier processing,wider information distribution, and greater data storage. 
         IT help businesses work more efficiently. IT increases value, improve quality, and increase productivity.  </p>
</div>
<h3>1.1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2>
<p>Methods used to complete digital come in all shapes and sizes from waterfall which uses
     “eight Waterfall stages conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation, and maintenance”.

      <a href= "https://www.wearefutureheads.com/news-and-views/waterfall-vs-agile-vs-lean-project-management/">[2]</a>
      To Agile which has itself had lots of variants such as SCRUM, Agile uses the principle of starting with a basic outline idea, 
      then work on it in small teams or modules, teams then work in sprints and complete tasks to a time scale which can then be reviewed and shown to investors to highlight progress and development.
        Other methods include PRINCE2 and Extreme programming,these all go through a similar process, which according to Kasper Nymand a writer on forecast. it goes
        <ol>
            <li>Scoping </li>
            <li>Planning </li>
            <li>Development</li>
            <li>Testing & Deployment </li>
            <li>Maintenance </li>           
        </ol> 
        Scoping is the brainstorming process, where ideas are evaluated and different options can be assessed for their viability. 
        Planning is where more detail is added and ideas are fleshed out, requirements and user experience are brought into the picture. 
        Development stage is where the rough elements are refined and development teams come in to test and expand key features. 
        Testing and deployment involves doing a quality assessment and checking for final bugs and ironing out the last few problems before release for the user to use. 
        Finally maintenance is used to keep the product supported and making sure it is stable.
        <br>
        Skills needed to create a digital project can vary, from knowing how to code using Javascript, ability to use HTML and CSS. 
        Being able to understand how to use FTP (file transfer protocol) works and also social media to access millions for people to help grow the project. 
        Other skills include being proficient in copywriting and editing. Skills can also be more general and can help teams organise and communicate, 
        examples of this may be problem solving, negotiation and having an attention to detail.
        <br>
        Resources needed to create and run a digital project come in lots of shapes and foams, 
        from software such as Trello which allows a team to plan and contribute to ideas in the planning stages. 
        Other software such as Xcode help with design and coding software such as Visual Studio Code can create the back of house functions to bring your project to life.

         </p>
         <h3>1.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. </h3>
         <p>There are a variety of software out there to help plan and carry out tasks for making a website. 
             From experience I found that using software like Trello provided the essential tools to plot out exactly what was needed to be done, 
             each individual task could be assigned a note that breaks up tasks into separate components so a website app or any form of project can be easily planned and completed. 
             “A Trello board is a list of lists, filled with cards, used by you and your team. It’s a lot more than that, though. Trello has everything you need to organize projects of any size.” 
             <a href= "https://trello.com/en-GB/tour">[3]</a> 
            </p>
            <h3>1.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h3>
            <p>There are many potential risks that might cause adverse effects on your digital project, 
                from game breaking code which may have knock on effects to other systems. 
                Being hacked or a digital forced entry will be a have devastating impact on your project. 
                Violating a copyright even if by accident could hinder progress and force a complete rewrite of many essential features.  
            </p>
            <h3>1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h3>
            <p>There are several methods one can go about selecting and using IT systems and software, these can range from software which is familiar to the user,
                so that the speed of learning is greatly increased, which could reduce production time and costs. 
                Another method is to research different available software so that you can hand pick and have tailor made features that best fit your IT project.
                 “Doing your research upfront will help you avoid the time-sink of switching solutions down the road.” <a href= "https://zapier.com/blog/best-business-software/.">[4]</a>
                  If you analyse what you need you can ascertain what we will work and what will not. Asking people in relevant areas may offer crucial advice on how systems and software worked best for them, 
                  this could be for many reasons but some might be applicable to you, giving you a one up and allow you to predict certain obstacles that could crop up in the future, so ask for advice and help. 
                </p>
                <h3>1.1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h3>
                <p>A great example of how a certain technology has helped achieve an outcome is Trello. Trello allowed me to plan, assess and comment on every aspect of a project, 
                    it separated tasks into smaller chunks so that the overall process didn’t seem too daunting. It was the ideal software for team assignments. We can comment on what work needs to be done, has been started and has been finished. 
                    The Kanban principle streamlined tasks and helped teams prioritise their work in an easy to see and simple way of plan and achieve certain outcomes. Another is Git and Github, 
                    this software is a “web-based service for version control using Git. Basically, it is a social networking site for developers. 
                    You can look at other people’s code, identify issues with their code and even propose changes. This also helps you in improving your code.
                     On a lighter note, it is a great place to show off your projects and get noticed by potential recruiters.”<a href= "https://codeburst.io/git-and-github-in-a-nutshell-b0a3cc06458f" >[5]</a> 
                     Github can prove extremely useful in bouncing ideas with a community and also it allowed me to upload code made on Javascript for my tutor Liam to see and assess to help me improve and develop my coding ability.
                     </p>
                     <h3>1.1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h3>
                     <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been brought in to help protect Internet and software users data, it works on several areas to ensure customers have to give consent to how their data will be stored and processed. 
                         Sections where GDPR have been greatly increased to include, ‘Active opt-in’ where users will have to give consent, meaning they will have to tick a box to say whether accept how their data will be used. 
                         Next is ‘Granular’ where users will get all the information on how their data is processed. Then there is ‘`Unbundling’ where terms and conditions must be set apart from consent. 
                         This was followed by a ‘Not a precondition of service’ which means consent does not mean a precondition of signing up unless it is a newspaper subscription. 
                         Finally there is ‘Named’ which entails it should be clear you the user who is processing their data and this includes third party companies. All these aspects will impact on Digital projects,
                          maybe causing users to avoid signing up, or the slow down of getting to the content causes users to try another platform however i believe having customers see this information helps them make more informed decisions about who and why their data is being used. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Outcome 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful. </h2>
                        <h3>1.2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? </h3>
                        <p> The tools needed to successfully create a digital media project, come in all shapes and sizes. My experience coming into Codenation was very limited, however as the weeks have progressed I have started to develop a sense of what works and the features that each piece of software in corporates to build an app or website. Tools such as Trello have now become a foundation for my work, Trello allows me to set out the plan and use the kanban principle to identify each task that needs to be completed. It helps organise and order tasks in terms of progress and importance, so the project can run smoothly and you can see improvement on a daily basis. Coding software such as Visual studio code has been a steep learning curve for me, I was unfamiliar with this tool before coming on the course and found it to have lots of features that seemed complicated. I do like how when writing lines of code in Javascript and HTML it provides a colour highlight to show the user what is accepted as a function of the code. This has proved invaluable in helping me spot syntax errors and helped me correct them quickly. I have also used Xcode to develop a coffee app, this software was complicated but fairly was to get my head around, it set out the individual pages that then needed linking using tools in Xcode. My major concern with this piece of software was how slow it ran on the Macbook, to move the text box in an iphone screen design would take a few minutes of loading and in the meantime the screen would freeze causing a slow down in progress.  </p>

                        <h3>1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>

                        <h3>1.2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project </h3>

                        <h3>1.2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>

                        <h3>1.2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose<h3>

                        <h2>Outcome 3: Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems </h2>

                        <h3>1.3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency
                            </h3>

                        <h3>1.3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>

                        <h3>1.3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h3>
                        <p>Solutions to improve my productivity would be to maintain a focus on uploading tabs and notes to Trello, this process helps identify goals, tasks and duties to keep on top of the ball in terms of continuing to develop my website. To increase my own productivity on Visual studio code i would have to study more features the software offers, this could be done using Youtube videos and user guides on the internet. I feel this would give me a greater knowledge which as a consequence would make me more productive using the tools. </p>

                        <h3>1.3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
